GMT = UTC

Saved files are saved with UTC time,
ls -l show converted time.

System reads the CMOS-Clock (or RTC Real Time Clock) with hwclock
Current distros uses systemd-timedated

> timedatectl set-local-rtc 0   hardware clock uses GMT
                                change third line /etc/adjtime UTC or LOCAL
> timedatectl set-local-rtc 1   hardware clock uses local time
                                change third line /etc/adjtime UTC or LOCAL

Programs uses the glibc-lib to get the timezone. The lib
looks at /etc/localtime which is a link to the /usr/share/zoneinfo - it's
a folder!?! -> see set-timezone

> timedatectl status                        show current config
> timedatectl list-timezones | grep Europe
> timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Vienna    change the link to 
                                            timezone file in dir zoneinfo
                                                 (/etc/localtime)
