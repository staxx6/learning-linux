/       Root

/bin        Elementry Linux-CMDs for system controll 
            every user can use it. More in /usr/bin but
            most distros link to /bin, so no more diff.

/boot       Files to boot the system (mostly GRUB). In
            most distros have the kernel here

/dev        All device files. Dynamically from udev-System
            On most distros saved on RAM-Disk -> removed
            after restart

/etc        Config files for the whole system

/home       Home dirs

/lib[64]    Shared libraries or symbolic links to them.
            ./modules kernel modules
            On current distros link to /usr/lib

/lost+found Only in ext-filesystem. Unkown sectores after
            fsck

/media      Contains subdirectorys like cdrom or usb
            but now under /run/media/<user>/<devicename>

/opt        Additional packets. In most distors not used.
            Manjaro use it with > yay (AUR packages)

/proc       Subdirectorys with running processes. No real datas!
            Just representing linux internal management of processes

/root       Contains root files

/run        Contains on most distros process ID and some more
            infos about sys services. In the past saved in /var/run
            ./lock - locking files -> in old /var/lock
            On some distros completely or part of it is on RAM-Disk

/sbin       Linux-CMDs which are only can be used by admins
            On most distros now link to /usr/sbin

/share      Sometimes architecture independent files. Normal place
            is /usr/share

/srv        On some Distros server files

/sys        Contains the sysfs data system

/tmp        Contains tmp files but often in /var/tmp too

/usr        Contains all user programs, X-System, source code of Linux,

            ./bin       executable programs
            ./games     games; somtimes link to /usr/share/games
            ./include   C-Include-Files
            ./lib[64]   div. libs, a lot of subdirectorys for C-Compiler
            ./local     Programs and files which aren't from the Distro
            ./sbin      For root only startable programs
            ./share     Architecture independent files (example docu)
