GRUB = Grand Unifed Bootloader

> os-prober     looks for OS

The bootloader loads the kernel file from /boot/(vmlinuz)
z for packed
If the kernel is loaded it gives command to the init-system.

# Parameter
root=/dev/sda3  so kernel knows system partition

# Initrd
Kernel needs to access the system partition but can't do
it if the modul is not loaded for the fs. Which are located
in the fs... 
Solution is the initrd file which is loaded on startup on
the ram - /boot/initramfs file

# Configs
/etc/grub.d/ the scripts there are createing the real configs
in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

> update-grub   starts all scripts in /etc/grub.d
    00_header       Grub standard settings
    05_debian_theme colors
    10_linux        Menue entries
    20_linux_xen    Menue entries for VMs
    20_memtest86+   Menue entry for memtest (debian/ubuntu)
    30_os-prober    Menue entries for all other OS
    40_custom       Pattern for own cfgs
    41_custom       creates in grub.cfg the text from custom.cfg

/etc/default/grub   contains global settings
    GRUB_DEFAULT                standard entry - saved, "menuentry"
    GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT         only if one OS, time to show menu (it's black) "shift"
    GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET   =true   shows countdown
    GRUB_DISTRUBUTOR            evaluateb by 10_linux script
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX          considered by 10_linux and gives kernel options - every start
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT  considered by 10_linux and gives kernel options - not recovery
    GRUB_GFXMODE                evaluated by 00_header
    GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID     =true    if /dev/sda1 wanted
    GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY       =true 

# Shim
It's for the UEFI Secure Soot. It is a small program but it's 
signed and starts the GRUB

# Startup
In GRUB press E (edit) on one entry
You can add kernel options on a line wich looks like:
linux /boot/vmlinuz-n.n.n root=/dev/sdb13
F10 to start with the options
BUT this is not saved!

# GRUB-CLI
Start it with C
- insmod ext2   load driver fpr fs (works for ext4 too)
- set root='(hd1,13)'
- linux /boot/vmlinuz-n.n.n root=/dev/sdb13 ro
- initrd /boot/initrd-n.n.n
- boot

# Menue
Change on /boot/grub2/grub.cfg don't touch this (its read only)
