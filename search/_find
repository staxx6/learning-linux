> find                                  looks for all files in current path
> find -name '.e*'                      looks for files with starting ".e"

> find PATHNAME -path '*/bla/*.pdf'     looks for files (end with .pdf and is in /bla/ dir) in PATHNAME

                                        - without +/- files touched exactly before 5 days
> find -ctime                           looks the inode change (chmod changes this)

### Cross
-> rm
rm $(find . -name '*~')                 removes all backup files - CMD substitution/ replace
                                        - cmd could be too long by many matches

-> grep
find -name '*.tex' -type f -exec grep -q emacs {} \; -print
                              |                   |     |> without no output (it's gone to grep)
                              |                   |> terminate - line separated output by find  + for in ine line
                              |> execute with found files, represented with {}

                                        finds *.tex files WITH 'emacs' and print on screen

find -name '*' -maxdepth 1 -size -10k -exec grep -q case.*in {} \; -print > file
            |                       |> smaller as 10KiB
            |> all files in from here
