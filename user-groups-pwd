### Three types of users

- SuperUser alias Sys-Admin alias root
- Normal users
- System user for daemons and server-services

### passwd - User
/etc/passwd -> Login:Password:UID:GID:Name:Home-dir:Shell
                                |  |> Group ID
                                |> User Identification

# UID
Root has always UID=0. Server-services and daemons mostly between 1 and 999.
Normals users 1000 and ongoing.

- User name should be only max 8 chars and only lowercase

- /etc/skel standard configs for new home folders

# Groups
/etc/group
Group-name:Password:GID:User-list

In passwd is the primary group saved. Here to more
GID=0 for root; 1 to 99 for system services; 100 for users;
over 1000 for user created groups

## Passwords
-> /etc/shadow      Login:Password-Code:d1:d2:d3:d4:d5:d6:reserved
d1 last change
d2 when it's allowed to change
d3 when it's needed to be changed
d4 when user is warned for change
d5 when it will be fully deactivated after inactive pw
d6 since when acount deactivated

chage -d 0 -M 100 -E 2018-12-31 loginname
    user needs new pwd after login and a new one alle 100 days
    after 31.12.2018 it's deactivated

saved with SHA512 and salted so same PW aren't same hashed
defined in ENCRYPT_METHOD var in /etc/login.defs

### /etc/login.defs a lot of login/pwd stuff 

### PAM-Extension for passowrd quality

### makepassword if needing a lot of passowrds

### failog
Wrong logins /var/log/faillog (binary file) -configs->
/etc/login.defs
> faillog -u NAME           how many failed logins
> faillog -u NAME -m MAX    how many failed logins are allowed (logins.def?)
    > faillog -u name -r    restore user
> faillig -m MAX            for all users; beware of Root!
    > faillog -u root -m 0  

### Forgot root password?
Use a Live-System 
> mkdir /rescue
> mount -t auto /dev/xxx /rescue
> chroot /rescue                    makes to root dir
> passwd
> CTRL+D
> reboot

-- To prevent: 
- EFI/BIOS Deactivate all other bootable disks and set password
- Encrypt disk
